"""Tests for multi-currency handling.

The dashboard is meant to work for an investor reporting in any currency, with
holdings quoted in any number of others. These pin the conversion rules so a
portfolio does not silently come out 100x too large (the pence trap) or
inverted (the pair-direction trap).
